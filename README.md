This is an example application showcasing how to run a Java app on CircleCI 2.0.

This application uses the following tools: 

* Gradle
* Java 11
* PostgreSQL
* Spring Boot
* Thymeleaf

You can follow along with this project by reading the [documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-java/).
An older version of this sample project that uses Maven is accessible [here](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-java-spring/tree/maven) though it is no longer being actively maintained.

## Local Development

```
docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=circle_test -p 5432:5432 -itd circleci/postgres:12-alpine
```

Start up the Java application:
